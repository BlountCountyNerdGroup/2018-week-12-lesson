# Reflections on the asteroids project

The 3-week asteroids project was a lot of fun. We were able to have multiple challenges today like building the health bar (relatively easy) and building a health power up (harder). If I had more time, we could have even built an AI challenge, allowing them to control enemy ships. So lots of potential for variety and messing around, which is great for lessons.
